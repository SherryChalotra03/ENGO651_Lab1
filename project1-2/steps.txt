ENGO 651 Assignment requirements-- 

1. Activating Virtual Environment

1. Activate Virtual Environment: .venv\Scripts\activate
2. Note: If you encounter an execution policy error, you might need to change the policy for the current session: 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
Then, try activating again.

3. Set the Environment Variable in PowerShell
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost/ENGO651"

4. After running that, verify it's set by typing:
echo $env:DATABASE_URL

You should see: postgresql://postgres:123456@localhost/ENGO651

5. Set the Flask App (if not already set)
If your file is named application.py, you should also set the FLASK_APP variable:

$env:FLASK_APP = "application.py"

Again, verify it with: echo $env:FLASK_APP

6. Run Your Flask App
Now, start your application by running: flask run

or if you prefer to run it directly: python application.py
